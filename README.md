# TictactoewithJAVA
A simple terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java, where players take turns entering a number between 1 and 9 to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner or tie after each move and displays the result in the terminal. It provides a basic, text-based interface and is played entirely in the console.
